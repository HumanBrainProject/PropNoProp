# Seizure-like propagation in spiking network models
a computational study of responses of AdEx-based spiking networks to incoming seizure-like perturbation

Here you can find the code to reproduce figure 2 (d) of the paper entitled _"Seizure-like propagation in spiking network models"_ by Damien Depannemaecker, Mallory Carlu and Alain Destexhe 

The code in python use de Brian2 library (https://brian2.readthedocs.io/)

1- First run _Fig2d_Simulations.py_, output files are saved in the _Results_ folder.

2- Then run _Fig2d_PlotResults.py_ to plot the figure
